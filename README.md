# Predictive Modelling for Smuggling Pattern

An open-source research project exploring how to detect and predict smuggling risk using machine learning on heterogeneous data: tabular trade/inspection records, temporal trends, geospatial context, and network relationships.

The goal is to build transparent, reproducible baselines and a modular workflow that can be adapted to different jurisdictions and data sources while emphasizing responsible, ethical use.

## Key objectives
- Create a clean, reproducible ML pipeline in notebooks for EDA, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and explainability.
- Handle class imbalance and temporal leakage appropriately for operational risk scoring.
- Compare classic ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) with gradient boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost).
- Provide risk scoring with calibration and clear explanations (e.g., SHAP) to support decision-making.
- Offer a structure that can evolve toward deployment and monitoring.

## Repository status
This repository is newly initialized. Initial notebooks, sample data schema, and utilities will be added iteratively. The README outlines the intended structure and usage so you can prepare your environment.

Consider adding a .gitignore to exclude large or sensitive files (e.g., data/raw, models, .ipynb_checkpoints).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Git
- pip or conda

### Set up a virtual environment (choose one)

Using venv + pip:
```
python -m venv .venv
# Activate
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate

# Install core scientific stack (will refine once requirements.txt is added)
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install jupyter pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost lightgbm catboost shap imbalanced-learn
# Optional (if doing geo/network features): geopandas folium networkx pyproj
```

Using conda:
```
conda create -n smuggling-ml python=3.10 -y
conda activate smuggling-ml
conda install -c conda-forge jupyter pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn shap imbalanced-learn xgboost lightgbm catboost -y
# Optional: conda install -c conda-forge geopandas folium networkx pyproj -y
```

### Launch notebooks
```
jupyter lab
# or
jupyter notebook
```

## Data expectations
No real-world sensitive data is included. To experiment, prepare a CSV (or Parquet) with columns like the following. Adapt as needed:

- event_id: unique identifier
- event_timestamp: UTC datetime of shipment/inspection
- origin_country, destination_country
- origin_port, destination_port (or lat/lon)
- transport_mode: air, sea, road, rail, mail, etc.
- commodity_code, commodity_description
- declared_value, weight_kg, volume_cbm, package_count
- consignor_risk_flag, consignee_risk_flag (0/1)
- route_history: optional string or normalized table capturing transshipment
- inspection_type, inspection_result
- label: 0/1 indicating confirmed smuggling/seizure (target)

Keep PII and sensitive attributes out of the dataset or ensure proper governance. Prefer irreversible identifiers where linking is required.

### Recommended feature engineering
- Time: hour-of-day, day-of-week, month, holiday, rolling aggregates (e.g., last-7-day route risk)
- Geography: distance between origin/destination, risk by port, clustering of routes
- Networks: entity and route graphs (centrality, community) using networkx
- Commodity: rarity, historical anomaly scores
- Operational: past inspection hit-rate per route/entity, recency/frequency metrics

## Modeling approach
- Problem framing: binary classification for “smuggling risk” with probabilistic outputs (risk score 0-1)
- Class imbalance: class_weight, focal/weighted loss, or sampling strategies (SMOTE/undersampling)
- Evaluation: ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, F1 (at selected operating point), calibration (Brier), and cost-sensitive metrics
- Validation: time-aware splits (e.g., TimeSeriesSplit) to prevent leakage
- Baselines: Logistic Regression, RandomForest, XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost
- Explainability: SHAP values, permutation importance, partial dependence; report global and local explanations
- Calibration: Platt/Isotonic calibration to make risk scores interpretable

## Reproducibility
- Pin dependencies in requirements.txt (to be added)
- Set random seeds where possible
- Save data processing code and model artifacts with metadata (version, hash, timestamp)

## Ethics, safety, and compliance
- This project is for research and educational purposes.
- Do not deploy without legal review, bias assessment, and strict governance.
- Avoid features that encode protected characteristics or proxies.
- Continuously monitor for drift and disparate impact.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add initial notebooks (01–06)
- [ ] Create requirements.txt and environment files
- [ ] Provide synthetic example dataset and data schema validator
- [ ] Implement time-aware cross-validation utility
- [ ] Add experiment tracking (e.g., MLflow) and model registry
- [ ] Add SHAP-based reporting notebook
- [ ] Optional: simple FastAPI service for batch scoring
