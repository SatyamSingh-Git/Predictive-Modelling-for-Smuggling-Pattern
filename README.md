This project explores how to detect and predict smuggling risk from heterogeneous signals: trade and inspection data, temporal trends, geospatial context, and network relationships. It provides strong, explainable baselines with a focus on ethical use and operational realism.

Why it matters:
- High-precision signals reduce unnecessary inspections while catching more true risks.
- Transparent models and explanations build trust with analysts and policymakers.
- Reproducible pipelines accelerate research and real-world evaluation.

## Highlights
- End-to-end workflow: EDA → feature engineering → modeling → evaluation → explainability → calibration
- Time-aware validation to avoid leakage in real operations
- Robust handling of class imbalance (weights, focal loss, sampling)
- Interpretable risk scoring with SHAP, permutation importance, and partial dependence
- Clear path to deployment: calibrated probabilities, thresholding strategies, and monitoring hooks

## Repository Status
This repo is newly initialized. Notebooks, utilities, and example data scaffolds will land incrementally. Star or watch to follow along.

Tip: add a `.gitignore` to exclude `data/raw`, `models`, `.ipynb_checkpoints`, and caches.

## Quickstart

1) Environment
```bash
# venv
python -m venv .venv
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install jupyter pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn \
            xgboost lightgbm catboost shap imbalanced-learn \
            pyarrow

# Optional (geo + network features)
# pip install geopandas folium networkx pyproj
```

2) Launch notebooks
```bash
jupyter lab
# or
jupyter notebook
```

3) Bring your data (see schema below), place in `data/raw/`, then start with `notebooks/01_data_overview.ipynb`.

## Data Schema (example)
Target: label (0/1, confirmed smuggling/seizure)

Recommended fields:
- event_id: unique identifier
- event_timestamp: UTC datetime
- origin_country, destination_country
- origin_port, destination_port (or lat/lon)
- transport_mode: air, sea, road, rail, mail, etc.
- commodity_code, commodity_description
- declared_value, weight_kg, volume_cbm, package_count
- consignor_risk_flag, consignee_risk_flag (0/1)
- route_history: string or normalized table for transshipment hops
- inspection_type, inspection_result
- label: 0/1 (target)

Privacy note: Exclude PII and sensitive attributes or ensure proper governance. Prefer irreversible IDs and aggregated features.

## Feature Engineering (starter ideas)
- Temporal: hour/day/month, holidays, rolling route/entity risk (7d/30d)
- Geography: great-circle distance, port congestion/risk stats, route clustering
- Networks: entity and route graphs (centrality, communities) via NetworkX
- Commodity: rarity, historical anomaly scores, HS code ontology groupings
- Operations: historical hit-rates, recency/frequency, officer/port-level effects

## Modeling Strategy
- Framing: binary classification → calibrated risk scores (0–1)
- Imbalance: class_weight, focal/weighted loss; SMOTE/undersampling for comparisons
- Validation: TimeSeriesSplit or forward chaining; embargo windows to avoid leakage
- Metrics: ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, F1 at ops threshold, Brier score (calibration), cost-aware metrics
- Baselines: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost
- Explainability: SHAP (global + local), permutation importance, PDP/ICE
- Calibration: Platt (sigmoid) or Isotonic for interpretable probabilities

## Example: Minimal Training Skeleton
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit
from sklearn.metrics import average_precision_score, roc_auc_score, brier_score_loss
from lightgbm import LGBMClassifier
from sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV

df = pd.read_parquet("data/processed/train.parquet")
X = df.drop(columns=["label"])
y = df["label"].astype(int)

tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)
oof_pred = y.copy().astype(float)
oof_pred[:] = float("nan")

for fold, (tr, va) in enumerate(tscv.split(X, y)):
    clf = LGBMClassifier(
        n_estimators=1000,
        learning_rate=0.03,
        max_depth=-1,
        subsample=0.8,
        colsample_bytree=0.8,
        class_weight="balanced",
        random_state=42,
    )
    # Fit with early stopping on time-ordered validation
    clf.fit(X.iloc[tr], y.iloc[tr],
            eval_set=[(X.iloc[va], y.iloc[va])],
            eval_metric="auc",
            verbose=False)
    # Probability calibration
    cal = CalibratedClassifierCV(clf, method="isotonic", cv="prefit")
    cal.fit(X.iloc[va], y.iloc[va])
    oof_pred.iloc[va] = cal.predict_proba(X.iloc[va])[:, 1]

print("ROC-AUC:", roc_auc_score(y, oof_pred))
print("PR-AUC:", average_precision_score(y, oof_pred))
print("Brier:", brier_score_loss(y, oof_pred))
```

## Interpretability Snapshot
- Global: feature importance (gain/permutation), SHAP summary plots
- Local: SHAP force plots and decision explanations for a single shipment
- Reporting: auto-generate a concise, analyst-friendly PDF/HTML from `notebooks/05_explainability.ipynb`

## Calibration and Thresholding
- Choose operating points by maximizing expected utility or cost-weighted F1
- Align score bands (e.g., Low/Medium/High) with inspection capacity
- Monitor post-deployment drift and recalibrate periodically

## Reproducibility and Governance
- Pin dependencies in `requirements.txt` (planned)
- Seed experiments; log versions and data hashes
- Optional: MLflow for experiment tracking; DVC for data pipelines
- Record model cards and bias assessments before any deployment

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add initial notebooks (01–06)
- [ ] Create `requirements.txt` and environment files
- [ ] Synthetic dataset + schema validator
- [ ] Time-aware cross-validation utilities (embargo/gap)
- [ ] Experiment tracking (MLflow) and model registry
- [ ] SHAP-based reporting templates
- [ ] Optional: FastAPI batch scoring service + Dockerfile
- [ ] Monitoring: drift, performance dashboards
